# Debate App - TheHackLab Bocconi

Welcome to our Debate App Project, created for TheHackLab Bocconi. This application is designed to facilitate debates for amateurs and foster a community of debating enthusiasts.

## Overview

The Debate App is a project aimed at hosting engaging and organized debates under the parlimentary procedure (more formats to come in the future). It hosts a platform for matchmaking with friends or strangers and aims to encourage community-building and collaboration. The app was submitted to the first ever Bocconi TheHackLab competition and presented to the 'Bocconi 4 Innovation' startup accelerator.

## Features

- **Create Debates**: Initiate new debate topics with friends or strangers.
- **AI powered Feedback**: Using the ChatGPT Api, the app offers a summary of all the arguments throughout the debate and provides feedback on the performance of each participant.
- **Participant Interaction**: Multiple participants can join and contribute to ongoing debates as a jury. Passive viewers score the performances which in turn enriches the quality of the feedback provided.
- **Argument Management**: Submit, edit, and refine arguments in advance using the personal notes editor-
- **Simple and Intuitive UI**: User-friendly design focused on seamless interaction.
